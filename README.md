=========
This code is in a very early form.  There has not been any refactoring at this point.  
It is written in C# and you will need API keys from Twitter, Bitly and TinySong to get it to work.

The whole project could have been built with a NoSQL or Document Database like CouchBase or Mongo.  A bunch of caching could be done with Redis as well.

I might fork the project just to get it working with CouchBase if I have time.
